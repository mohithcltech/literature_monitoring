    <!-- <h2>Hypothetical Abstract</h2>
    <p>This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a structured physical activity (PA) program on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were assigned to either a 12-week PA program or a control group that received no intervention. The study found that participants in the PA group showed significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to the control group. However, 15% of the participants in the PA group reported experiencing muscle strain, and 10% reported fatigue. One individual in the PA group also reported severe joint pain. Additionally, two complaints were recorded about the quality of the provided resistance bands, citing breakage during exercises. Despite these issues, the majority of feedback indicated that the PA program was beneficial for mental health without any serious adverse events related to the program.</p> -->
